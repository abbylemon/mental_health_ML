# Why Mental Health is Important


Mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking or behavior (or a combination of these). Mental illnesses are associated with distress and/or problems functioning in social, work or family activities. This does not include culturally sanctioned response to negative events, such as the loss of a loved one.[1]

Estimates show that the price of mental health care and lost productivity due to mental illnesses cost the U.S. economy more than $444 billion each year. Mental illnesses are common and in a given year nearly 19% of US adults experience some sort of mental illness, 4% have a serious mental illness and 8.5% have a diagnosable substance use disorder.[2] But the good thing is that meltal illnesses are treatable. If the stigma of mental health was removed and mental health care was provided, these mental health statisics could be lowered.
