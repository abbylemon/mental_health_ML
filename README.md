# Mental Health in Tech and Machine Learning

## Getting Started

This project uses AWS to store the data files in a S3 bucket and uses Google Colab notebooks to extract, transform, load, and analyze that data.

To set up AWS and Google Drive for this project, run through the cells in the [cloud_setup.ipynb](./cloud_setup.ipynb) notebook.

After setting up AWS and Google Drive, run through the cells in the [cloud_etl.ipynb](./cloud_etl.ipynb) notebook to load the csv files from the S3 bucket into Spark dataframes.
