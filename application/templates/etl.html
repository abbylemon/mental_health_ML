        The data used for this project comes from an annual survey called Mental Health in Tech Survey conducted by
        Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI). OSMI is a non-profit organization that helps support and raise awareness
        for
        mental health in the tech and open source communities. The survey is specifically intended for those working
        within
        the tech community and is meant to capture attitudes toward mental health in the workplace. OSMI publishes the
        results on
        <a href="https://osmihelp.org/research" target="_blank">their website</a>, including a link to each survey
        year's raw csv files, published
        on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/osmihelp/osmi-mental-health-in-tech-survey-2019" target="_blank">kaggle</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this project, the raw csv files were uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. Then, using Google Colab and Pandas, data
        was loaded
        from S3 into Pandas dataframes for transforming.

      <p>
        The transformation steps for this project were completed within Google Colab, a notebook that executes code on
        Google's cloud servers. Google Colab was chosen, instead of Jupyter Notebook, as it allowed project team members
        to work simultaneously
        on the same notebook, and avoid git merge conflicts that often happen while working collaboratively with Jupyter
        Notebook.

        One challenge the team faced when cleaning the survey data was figuring out which columns to keep and remove.
        The original
        csv files included over 100 columns, one for each of the Mental Health in Tech Survey questions. Columns were
        reviewed and removed
        if they were either deemed not necessary or not useful to the project goal. In the raw csv files, each column is
        a survey question (for example, "Have you ever sought treatment for a mental health disorder from a mental
        health professional?").
        To make loading and querying the database easier, time was spent changing the names of the columns as well as
        standardizing the
        format to be snake and lower case (for example, sought_treatment_for_mental_health).
      </p>

      <p>
        Another hurdle while cleaning the data was to capture question changes between years, as the survey has expanded
        over
        time. Questions were tracked for each survey year and each yearâ€™s individual dataframes were edited by
        adding new columns for missing questions and re-ordering as needed so that all the years would match up when
        appended.
        Values were saved as null if a survey question was not answered or if a year had additional questions that other
        years did not have.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lastly, because this project uses a SQL database, the rest of the data transformation involved ensuring the
        final dataframe columns
        and data types matched the schema.

      <p>
        After transforming the data, the final step in the ETL process was loading the data into SQL. SQLAlchemy was
        used to create the schema,
        including defining classes and creating the tables. The data for this project is stored in a Postgres database
        that is hosted
        and managed on AWS using their Relational Database Service (RDS).
